# Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run npm install
3. Ensure you are using node 12.0.0 and run `npm install`
4. Running `node index.js` from the root will generate an output file in the `data` directory containing the results based on the input file located there.
5. If you are interested in running the test suite ensure you have Jest installed and run `npm run test`. Coverage can be found under the `coverage` directory.
